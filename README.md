Cryptographic Enforcement of Patient Consent in Partially Trusted Health Record Repositories

/evaluation_results/
This directory contains processed result files used directly in the manuscript, including:
- Mean cryptographic processing latency values
- Aggregated performance tables
- Data used to generate Figures 7–12
- Summary statistics for:
-- Episode creation
-- Episode update
-- Patient access
-- Delegation
-- Emergency access

/simulation_outputs/
This directory contains raw experimental outputs generated during simulation runs, including:
- Per-run latency measurements (multiple repetitions per configuration)
- CSV files containing:
-- Record count vs latency
-- Delegation size vs latency
-- Emergency disclosure scope vs latency
- Intermediate measurement logs
